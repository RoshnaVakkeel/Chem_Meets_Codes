<h3><i>A website for Scientists and Techies alike.. 
<br>
This website attempts to give you a glimpse into how two totally unrelated fields find a synchrony, paving way for new fields to emerge. The emergence and evolution of Computers, its Programming Languages and internet has created many interdisciplinary fields in science today. The website walks you through the history of computer-aided drug design and how it came to existance.

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<p><strong>CHEM MEETS CODES </strong> is much like my own story - "A Chemist learning to Code". 
The word Chemist is a misnomer to define me, while the area of research as a Chemist often spans several disciplines these days. My experience ranges from Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Bio-organic Chemistry, Supramolecular Chemistry, Biomaterials to Cell Biology. This shows that no single subject defines our field of study today. It is an era of <i>"Interdisciplinarity/ Interdisciplinary Studies"</i>. No research project exists today that doesn't tow the same line or speak one language. So are the Techies, so many different programming languages co-existing brilliantly to get to a higher goal usually termed <i>Website, App or Software</i>, just to name a few. Chemists use often without how so many powerful and brilliantly engineered softwares are built. And so is it with the Coders/ Programmers who are unaware of the scientific fields Computers and the languages built have transformed. 
<br>
This website tries to bring the stories of two worlds together and attempts to show how their timelines progressed. It is a work in progress and provides an introduction to the history of the two constantly progressing fields.

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">INTRODUCTION</h2>
A history based website displaying how programming languages and computational chemistry evolved over the last decade. The website provides the details on the timeline of the new field "computer-aided drug design (CADD)" emerged and advanced with the programming language and Information Technology Evolution. And how it has impacted our lives, and its importance in the present and future. 
<br>

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600";>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p text-align: justify>Chem Meets Codes is a website developed broadly for students, computational research enthusiasts and IT application enthusiasts. Website discusses the topic of Structural evolution in Chemistry and  Programming Language evolution in Computers. Thus, it would be appealing to students and researchers with a biological/chemical as well as a computational background. Topics are planned to be continuously expanded and open for contributions from the community.

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">DESIGN</h2>
<h3 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">WEBSITE STRUCTURE</h3>
<p>The website features three webpages (can be found in the navigation menu featured on the upper right hand corner of each page). First page is <a href="index.html">Homepage</a>, which is also the landing page. As it is a history based website, another webpage featuring <a href="timeline.html">Timeline</a> is included. As this is an attempt to bring two mega giants of fields together. This website has a scope of contantly to be updated, which is enormous. That is why a third webpage <a href="feedback.html">Feedback</a> is included. Visitors to the website can enter their feedback and comments, referring to which further updates can be regularly included in the website.

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p> GitHub pages were used to deploy the site.</p>
<p>The steps to activate Github pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First the repository was created using the gitpod template provided by the Code Insitute.</li>
    <li>Using the command <i>git add <filename></i>, the changes are staged to be pushed into the repository and staged changes are committed tp the local repository using <i>git commit -m 'short descriptive message'.</i></li>
    <li>Using <i>git push</i>, the changes are updated in the repository.</li>
    <li> Github automatically deploys my latest commit from the 'main' branch to the Github pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri', sans-serif; font-weight: 600">DEPLOYMENT</h2>
<p> GitHub pages were used to deploy the site.</p>
<p>The steps to activate Github pages:</p>
