Welcome RoshnaVakkeel,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

<h3><i>A website created purely using HTML and CSS</i></h3>
<br>
<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri';"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
A history based website displaying how programming languages and computational chemistry evolved over the last decade. The website provides the details on the timeline of the new field "computer-aided drug design (CADD)" emerged and advanced with the programming language and Information Technology Evolution.It gives a glance of how it has impacted our lives, and its importance in the present and future. 
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-style: 'Calibri';"><strong>Description</strong></h2>
CompMeetsCodes is a website developed for students, computational research enthusiasts, IT application enthusiasts. Website discusses the topic of Structural evolution in Chemistry and  Programming Language evolution in Computers. Thus, it would be appealing to students and researchers with a biological/chemical as well as a computational background. Topics are planned to be continuously expanded and open for contributions from the community.

Python programming introduction
The TeachOpenCADD platform is not a Python programming course from scratch but teaches how to solve tasks in cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics programmatically. If you wish to get started first with a Python programming introduction before diving into the TeachOpenCADD material, here are a few great resources to do so:

AI in Medicine course by the Volkamer Lab and Ritter Lab at the Charité: Introduction to Python basics, Jupyter Notebook, and important data science packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn
Python for Chemists course by the GDCh/CIC team: Crash-course introduction to Python for natural scientists
MolSSI Education Resources by The Molecular Sciences Software Institute: Collection of tutorials on Python programming basics and data analysis but also more advanced material on software development and computational molecular science
Core lessons by the Software Carpentry: Introduction to Python, Git, command line interfaces and more
Cheminformatics resources
The following resources are collections of interesting cheminformatics-related training material, blogs, and books.

Curated list of resources from the RDKit UGM 2020
A Highly Opinionated List of Open Source Cheminformatics Resources by Pat Walters
Awesome Cheminformatics by Yi Hsiao
