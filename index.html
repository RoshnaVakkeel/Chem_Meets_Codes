            <p>The endeavour of this website is to provide you an essence of the journey of two distinguished
                disciplines - "Chemistry" and "Computers", joined forces to create the field of "Computational
                Chemistry". Since its inception, many of it's breakthroughs has been silently transforming our lives.
                Glance through and reflect how the revolution in the world of programming, programs new fields of study.
