            <h2>Computers in Chemistry - The beginning</h2>
            <p>The use of computers in chemistry started in the late 1950s with acceptance of Fortran as a scientific programming language. History depicts data entry, transfer and processing via suitable programs, and processed results display on a local device. In the mid 1970's, protein structure was crystallographically solved and visualized with computers for the first time. One of the large advantages was that the computer recorded atomic coordinates. </p>

        <h2>The Programming Language - History through decades</h2>
        <p>Long before the computers came into existance, programming languages were created and were being reinvented a few times. In 1843, Ada Lovelace created the very first machine algorithm. This marked the beginning of the invention of programming languages. Then in early 1940s, Konrad Zuse created the programming language that was called Plankalkul ( first high-level programming language developed for computers). The very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">assembly language</a> and shortcode were first put into effect in 1949</p>
