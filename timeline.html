        <h2>Computers in Chemistry - The beginning</h2>
        <p>The use of computers in chemistry started in the late 1950s with acceptance of Fortran as a scientific
            programming language. History depicts data entry, transfer and processing via suitable programs, and
            processed results display on a local device. In the mid 1970's, protein structure was crystallographically
            solved and visualized with computers for the first time. One of the large advantages was that the computer
            recorded atomic coordinates. And in the last few decades, the progress has been enormous. The timeline
            depicted here reveals how the landscape of CADD evolved and became an important part of research today. Many
            companies emered and so did the tools. The image below shows how the progress took place in the last few
            decades.</p>

        <h2>The Programming Language - History through decades</h2>
        <p>Long before the computers came into existance, programming languages were created and were being reinvented a
            few times. In 1843, Ada Lovelace created the very first machine algorithm. This marked the beginning of the
            invention of programming languages. Then in early 1940s, Konrad Zuse created the programming language that
            was called Plankalkul ( first high-level programming language developed for computers) <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">assembly language</a> and
            shortcode were first put into effect in 1949. Corrado BÃ¶hm in 1951 created the first high-level language.
            The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 by a team led
            by John Backus at IBM. This also coincides with the Chemistry community started using these languages to
            develop the tools. The timeline below shows the development timeline in the following decades. </p>
